👋 My name is Tong Nie (聂通 in Chinese). I'm currently a third-year PhD student at both The Hong Kong Polytechnic University and Tongji University, supervised by [Prof. Jian Sun](https://tops.tongji.edu.cn/info/1031/1187.htm) and [Dr. Wei Ma](http://weima171.com/). My PhD research project was conducted under the support of the [PolyU Presidential PhD Fellowship Scheme](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/gs/prospective-students/fellowship-scholarship-schemes/pppfs/), and was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC). Prior to joining PolyU, I earned my B.S. (2022) in Civil Engineering at Tongji University, Shanghai, China.
I'm now conducting research with the [PolyU Mobility AI Lab](http://polyu-mobility-ai-lab.com/) and [TOPS](https://tops.tongji.edu.cn/).

My research focuses on developing learning-based solutions to advance the sensing, modeling, and managing of transportation systems, with a particular interest in **spatiotemporal models**. From a **macro** perspective, I have developed: 

- **Tensor-based low-rank models for sparse sensing of traffic data**, e.g., point-wise traffic data imputation and sensor-wise traffic flow estimation:
  - [Truncated tensor Schatten p-norm based approach for spatiotemporal traffic data imputation with complicated missing patterns](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trc.2022.103737) (TRC 2022)
  - [Correlating sparse sensing for large-scale traffic speed estimation: A Laplacian-enhanced low-rank tensor kriging approach](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trc.2023.104190) (TRC 2023)
    
- **Generalizable graph neural networks and Transformers**, e.g., Transformers combined with the graph inductive bias:
  - [Towards better traffic volume estimation: Jointly addressing the underdetermination and nonequilibrium problems with correlation-adaptive GNNs](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trc.2023.104402) (TRC 2023)
  - [ImputeFormer: Low Rankness-Induced Transformers for Generalizable Spatiotemporal Imputation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3637528.3671751) (KDD 2024)
  
- **Simple-yet-efficient models for large-scale time series forecasting**, e.g., MLP-Mixers, Low-rank channel mixing, and lightweight graph Transformers:
  - [Channel-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation in Time Series Forecasting](https://doi.org/10.1145/3627673.3679884) (CIKM 2024)
  - [Contextualizing MLP-Mixers Spatiotemporally for Urban Traffic Data Forecast at Scale](https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2024.3491754) (IEEE TITS 2024)

- **Implicit neural representations (INRs) for continuous spatiotemporal modeling**, e.g., meta learning based INRs:
  - [Spatiotemporal Implicit Neural Representation as a Generalized Traffic Data Learner](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trc.2024.104890) (TRC 2024)
  - [Collaborative imputation of urban time series through cross-city meta-learning](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2501.11306) (ICLR 2025 workshop on weight space learning)

- **Location-based spatiotemporal modeling**:
  - [Joint Estimation and Prediction of City-wide Delivery Demand: A Large Language Model Empowered Graph-based Learning Approach](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tre.2025.104075) (TRE 2025)
  
From a **micro** perspective, I'm currently trying to develop models that learn to reconstruct, predict, and generate both *realistic* and *adversarial* traffic scenarios for the development and testing of end-to-end autonomous driving systems🚗.
- **Adversarial traffic scenario generation with LLMs**
   - [LLM-attacker: Enhancing Closed-loop Adversarial Scenario Generation for Autonomous Driving with Large Language Models](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2501.15850)

In addition to transportation, I'm also interested in large vision/language models, urban computing, sustainability science, AI for social good applications.
- **Geospatial AI**:
  - [Geolocation Representation from Large Language Models are Generic Enhancers for Spatio-Temporal Learning](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2408.12116) (AAAI 2025)
- **Sustainability science**:
  - Large Language Models as a New Modality for Earch Data Monitoring (ICLR 2025 workshop on tackling climate change with machine learning)
- **Large Language Models**:
  - [Exploring the Roles of Large Language Models in Reshaping Transportation Systems: A Survey, Framework, and Roadmap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21411)
